# ml_pull_req_project
i have done this project as part of my course methods and applications of machine learning at TU clausthal 
project description as follows
For the project, we give you access to a database we actively use for our research on open source software development. The database contains information collected from the version control system, the issue tracker, and the mailing lists of the projects
The database contains data for many Apache Projects. For your group projects, only select the projects that have at least 100 closed pull requests in the database.

Your task is to develop an automated model to predict the acceptance of pull request. The model should be designed so that it can be used on GitHub, for example, to show an indicator if the pull request is likely to be accepted. Additionally, try to predict the time until the pull request is accepted using a different machine learning model from the lecture.

You have to frame these questions into an analytic problem. Then, you have to create models that can be used to answer the questions. You have to choose appropriate features from the available data for this and decide which kind of analytic approach to use. Finally, you have to evaluate how well your approach performs.
